This is the repo for my final project

First commit - basic setup

Second commit - readme setup

Third commit - results page setup (accidentally missed from basic setup)

Fourth commit - Iterative cycle 1 part 1 - initial page layout with drag and drop algorithm selection (with placeholder for additional inputs) and general data input (plus shakespearean text additional feature hence addition of text file). Submit takes 2-4 algorithms however only opens empty results page.
